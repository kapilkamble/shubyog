This review is for a very kind, sweet, charming meditation Instructor, Shubhangi. In the month of March when carona was playing a big negative role in everyone's life. I have done her meditation classes for 2months. Her voice itself was so soothing that one can easily forget everything n just go in a flow of meditation. What meditation actually is i came to know because of her and  she has always helped me to stay positive.
