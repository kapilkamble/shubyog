Yoga I believe is working on inner self more than outer self and so is meditation. Thanks to Shubhangi for amazing meditation sessions which help me maintain my inner strength and peace in this lockdown situation. Hats off to the dedication she has to send meditation on time daily and even follow up and give personal guidance as per your health and needs. 
I had beautiful time learning meditation and Pranayam.
