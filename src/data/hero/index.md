Yoga has changed my attitude toward the life and towards the world. It has given me a new way to live a life. Yoga not only helps us to stay fit physically but it also helps to improve our mental health. It doesn't only stretches our muscles but also Strengthens our internal organs such as heart, lungs, intestines, kidneys etc.
